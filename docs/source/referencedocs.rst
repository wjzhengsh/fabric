Reference Documentation on APIs, SDK, and CA
===============

Read the reference documentation to learn more about Hyperledger Fabric's
APIs, SDKs, and certificate authority (CA) service.


API Documentation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The API documentation for Hyperledger Fabric's Golang APIs can be found on
the godoc site for `Fabric <https://godoc.org/github.com/hyperledger/fabric>`_.
If you plan on doing any development using these APIs, you may want to
bookmark those links now.

SDK Documentation and code
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Hyperledger Fabric offers a number of SDKs to support various programming
languages. There are two officially released SDKs for Node.js and Java:

  * `Hyperledger Fabric Node SDK <https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-node>`__ and `Node SDK documentation <https://fabric-sdk-node.github.io/>`__.
  * `Hyperledger Fabric Java SDK <https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-java>`__.

In addition, there are three more SDKs that have not yet been officially released
(for Python, Go and REST), but they are still available for downloading and testing:

  * `Hyperledger Fabric Python SDK <https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-py>`__.
  * `Hyperledger Fabric Go SDK <https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go>`__.
  * `Hyperledger Fabric REST SDK <https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-rest>`__.

CA Documentation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Hyperledger Fabric provides an optional
`certificate authority service <http://hyperledger-fabric-ca.readthedocs.io/en/latest>`_
that you may choose to use to generate the certificates and key material
to configure and manage identity in your blockchain network. However, any CA
that can generate ECDSA certificates may be used.
